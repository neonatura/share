You must install the 'gcc-java' package in order to provide the "jni.h" gcc header file for the java API to compile correctly. To install on linux run 'yum install gcc-java' or 'apt-get install gcc-java'. Use the configure option "--disable-java" in order to bypass java support.

SWIG is optional. Pre-built source code has been generated as part of the distritution. To install on linux run 'yum install swig' or 'apt-get install swig'.
